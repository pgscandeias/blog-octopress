Team chat apps are all the rage these days, and little wonder.

The larger the team,
the more difficult it is for everyone to be on the same IM network. Plus, IM
is awkward for more than two people. And good luck keeping logs when everyone
keeps switching from mobile to laptop and back.

Enter web chat apps.

Because a web app runs on the browser, there's nothing to download. Just
log onto a website and you're good to go. Plus, logs are saved automatically in the server
and, as a bonus, chat rooms can be persistent.

Sadly, having sampled quite a few offerings, I think there's a problem.
Some apps are too complicated, offering many features but requiring you to learn
yet another formatting system. Others are very expensive. 
Still others can't decide whether they're free or not. Some impose a team member
limit. Others only allow a few simultaneous connections. All in a bid to sell you
"extra features" and squeeze a few more dollars just so you can have a normal
chat experience.

So I went ahead and made **[Clarity](https://claritychat.com)**, a simple team chat web app
with a simple pricing model (just $9/month per project) and no limits on users or chat rooms. It's real time,
so you can have normal chats with your colleagues, and it's also persistent so
people can communicate with their team without everyone needing to be online at the 
same time. Chat history is persistent too, so it's always possible to recall
what was said.

It's **[online now](https://claritychat.com)**.
