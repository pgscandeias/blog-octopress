[Google Glass](http://www.google.com/glass/start/) looks like an amazing piece of kit.
But do I want one? Well...

* It looks ridiculous.
* It's a huge privacy concern for other people.
* Issuing voice commands in public is silly.

So no, not keen on wearing it in public every day at all.

In private, though...

* Taking in on a trek through unknown country seems potentially useful.
* Summoning a manual or an example video while working on my mountain bike would be nice.
* Wearing this under my paintball goggles in order to access map and tactical information would be awesome.

So yeah, I guess I want one. I just won't be seen wearing it.
