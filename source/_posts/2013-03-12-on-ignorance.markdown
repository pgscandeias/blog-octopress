So I just watched a couple videos of some pasty spanish dudes [explaining](http://www.verdade-carnal.info/) that they love veganism because of [photoshopped sci-fi landscapes](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuK65NqoiTo). I'm revolted at the degree to which their message is engineered for maximum dramatic effect at the expense of factual accuracy. 

By carefully peppering a few crumbs of truth across an argument, it's possible to make all of it come across as truthful by association. An audience that's not in full posession of the facts will easily be swayed by such arguments and intelligence makes little difference.

Preying upon ignorant audiences is easy and entirely too effective. The only defence is knowledge.

Don't be a puppet. Always be learning.
