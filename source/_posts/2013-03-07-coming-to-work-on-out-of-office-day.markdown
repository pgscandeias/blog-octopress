Today is, apparently, [Out of Office Day](https://www.facebook.com/outofofficeday) here in Portugal. It's a movement to raise awareness on remote working and as such I think it's a brilliant idea.

Indeed, I'm always going on about how mandatory office attendance and rigid 8+ hour workdays are not at all suited to today's information economy.

But I don't like to do things just for the sake of it. And I don't think that working remotely should be some kind of dogma. I believe in choosing what's best for one's needs.

So I chose not to adhere to Out of Office Day because it just happens that today I'd like to see my peers face to face and float ideas around, hoping for the sort of conversation that arises more easily when people are in the same vicinity.

I'm just glad I'm allowed to make that choice.
